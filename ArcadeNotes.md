# Arcade Notes

### Idea:  
   * Kids enjoy playing games at school.  
   * We can teach kids about cyber-security by sneaking it into their games.  
   * While kids play games, cyber-security trivia will pop-up and their answers will affect the game.  
   * Trivia will be topically (*loosely*) related to the game.  

### Games:  
   * Snake: Malware questions (worms)
   * Pacman: Cyber Bullying (Ghosts Bully Pacman)
   * Dig Dub: Phishing (triggering bolder or plugging enemy)
   * Tetris: Data Privacy (Complete line -> All of your information)
